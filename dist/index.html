    <h3>About BitMash and BFES LLC</h3>
    <p>
      BitMash is a free, browser-based media tool that transforms clean, high-quality audio and image files into intentionally low-fidelity, retro-styled versions. Powered by WebAssembly and FFmpeg, every conversion runs locally in your browser. This means no uploads to any servers, and no data ever leaves your device. Originally built to recreate the quirky, compressed audio effects found in old music videos and meme videos, BitMash has grown into a playful toolkit for reducing audio quality, pixelating images, and even combining them into offbeat video creations. It’s a simple, fun way to mangle your media in seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      BFES LLC is an independent software company founded in May 2025. Our mission is to create useful, engaging, and accessible digital tools for everyday users. No idea is too silly.
