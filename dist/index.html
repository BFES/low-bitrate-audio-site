    <h3>About Radio Sounds and BFES LLC</h3>
    <p>
      Radio Sounds is a free, browser-based audio converter that transforms clean, high-quality audio files into intentionally low-fidelity, "radio effect" versions. Powered by WebAssembly and FFmpeg, the entire process runs locally in your browser; this means no uploads, and no data ever leaves your device. The idea for this tool came from a personal interest in the quirky, low-quality audio effects often featured in online music videos, and a desire to make it simple and accessible for others to recreate that style.
    </p>
    <p>
      BFES LLC is an independent software company founded in May 2025. Our mission is to create useful, engaging, and accessible digital tools for everyday users. No idea is too silly. While we currently focus on web-based applications, we are excited to expand into new platforms and technologies in the future.
